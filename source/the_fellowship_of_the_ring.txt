Bilbo Baggins celebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring to Frodo, his heir.
Gandalf (a wizard) suspects it is a Ring of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it was lost by the Dark Lord Sauron and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire.
Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so.
Frodo sets out on foot with his cousin Pippin Took and gardener Sam Gamgee.
They are pursued by Black Riders, but meet some Elves, whose singing to Elbereth wards off the Riders.
The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck.
Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey.
They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest.
Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malign Old Man Willow, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil.
Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by a barrow-wight.
Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard.
The Hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they meet Strider, a Ranger.
The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend.
Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward the Elvish sanctuary of Rivendell.
At Weathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders.
Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade.
Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herb athelas.
They are joined by the Elf Glorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned by Elrond.

Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care.
Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are the Nazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Saur.
The Council of Elrond discusses what to do with the Ring.
Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir of Isildur who had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself.
The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed to Gollum and then to Bilbo.
Gandalf reports that the chief wizard, Saruman, is a traitor.
The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged.
Frodo takes this task upon himself.
Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn and Boromir, son of the Steward of Gondor; the Elf Legolas; and the Dwarf Gimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West.
After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through the Mines of Moria.
They learn that Balin and his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed by Orcs.
They are attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, a fire demon.
Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss.
The others escape to the Elvish forest of Lothlórien, where the Lady Galadriel tests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts.
She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel.
Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her.
Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread.
They travel down the River Anduin.
At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears.
Frodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts and joins him.
