### The Bow (Bag of Words) model

The **(BoW) bag-of-words** is a model based on unordered collections (a "bag") of words.  
It is used in **Natural Language Processing** and **Information Retrieval (IR)**.  
It disregards word order (and thus most of syntax or grammar) but captures multiplicity.  
(More on [BoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model), [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and [Information Retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval) on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page))

Examples:    
- `cargo run source/ "Where does Frodo recovers? And under whose care?"`
- `cargo run source/ "What year is Marty trapped in?"`
