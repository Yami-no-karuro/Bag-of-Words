# Rust - Bag of Words Embedder

## BoW (bag-of-words) embeddings model, in Rust

### Intro

The [(BoW) bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model is a model of text which uses an unordered collection (a "bag") of words.  
It is used in [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) and information retrieval (IR).  
It disregards word order (and thus most of syntax or grammar) but captures multiplicity.
