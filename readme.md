# Rust - Search Engine

## A Simple TF-IDF Search Engine, in Rust

### Introduction

In the field of **Information Retrieval**, the **TF-IDF** method (short for *Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency*) is a technique used to evaluate how important a word is within a document, taking into account how frequently that word appears across all documents in a collection.  
It is an enhancement of the classic **Bag-of-Words** model, which represents a document simply as a collection of words, ignoring their order.  
TF-IDF introduces a key idea: not all words are equally informative. Common terms like “the” or “and” appear frequently across documents and therefore provide little value in distinguishing content. In contrast, rarer terms can better identify the topic of a text.
